# Simple-terminal

Currently this is a small project for university homework
I hop that in the future I will continue this project and build
a "not so simple terminal" from it

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, and use the Makefile to run the project

```
make run
```

## Currently Supporting
* **input and output redirection**
* **all simple terminal commands**
* **only one pipe**-will get improved in the future

## Prerequisites

This project was built on Linux operating system.
the terminal will not work on other operating systems

## Contributing

the LineParser.c was not built by me, and belongs to the "Ben Gurion university of the negev"
this file will hopefully get replaced in the future.

## Versioning
